## Project Information
In this assignment we were given a massive amount of dataset from some emails, in this data set we had 2 different types a training set and a testing set, both of these data sets have spam and non spam emails. Using the data we got from these emails we created code to be able to test if the emails we have got are actual emails or a spam based on the words that are used in the file.

## Improvments
The main improvement that we made is making was a helper class that interacts directly with the files and retrieves every word from the individual files.

## How to Run
1. Clone the project from gitub to a directory of your choice.
2. Make sure you have a war exploded so you can run the API.
3. Once everything is there and you have the war exploded, run the API and it will open our HTML with the spam probability and our about me in the browser of your choice.
